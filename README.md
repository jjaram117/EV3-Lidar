# EV3-Lidar
Communication system made up of a trio of Python scripts to enable wireless control from a PC to a wired EV3 and Slamtec Lidar sensor.

The scripts "RunLidar.py" and "RunEV3.py" must be uploaded to the EV3, while the file "MainRun.py" runs on the PC 

The script "RunLidar_and_Plot_PC.py" allows for interface and control of the Lidar sensor directly through your PC. Just edit the Com Port variable to match the one your Lidar is plugged into
